		<p><font size="5"><center>Hi, my name's Andrew. Welcome to my website, I hope you enjoy your stay! Feel free to click wherever you wish.
	  I am a junior at Damien High School and I made this awesome website in my AP Computer Science Principles class. I enjoy playing football and soccer and watching The Office on my free time. I recently got the new Iphone 11 and I love all types of apple products. Some of my favorite movies are Cars, The Shining, and Monsters Inc. Im currently challenging myself academically by taking Honors and AP courses and participating in after school activities. </center> </font></p>
