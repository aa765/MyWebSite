	  I am a junior at Damien High School and I made this awesome website in my AP Computer Science Principles class. I enjoy playing football and watching the office on my free time. I recently got the new Iphone 11 and I love all types of apple products. My favorite movies are Cars, The Shining, and Monsters Inc.</center> </font></p>
